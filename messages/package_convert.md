# summary

Create a second-generation package version from a first-generation package.

# description

The package convert creates a new package in the Dev Hub if one does not already exist for the specified first-generation package.

It then creates a new package version in the Dev Hub with contents based on the specified first-generation package.

The latest released non-patch package version from the specified first-generation package will be converted.

To retrieve details about a package version create request, including status and package version ID (04t), run "<%= config.bin %> package version create report -i 08c...".

We recommend specifying the --installation-key to protect the contents of your package and to prevent unauthorized installation of your package.

To list package version creation requests in the org, run "<%= config.bin %> package version create list".

# examples

- Create a second-generation package version from the first-generation package with the specified ID and give it the installation key "password123"; uses your default Dev Hub org:

  <%= config.bin %> <%= command.id %> --package 033... --installation-key password123

- Similar to previous example, but uses the specified Dev Hub org:

  <%= config.bin %> <%= command.id %> --package 033... --installation-key password123 --target-hub-org devhuborg@example.com
