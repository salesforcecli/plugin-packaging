# cliDescription

creates a second-generation package version from a first-generation package

The package convert creates a new package in the Dev Hub if one does not already exist for the specified first-generation package.

It then creates a new package version in the Dev Hub with contents based on the specified first-generation package.

The latest released non-patch package version from the specified first-generation package will be converted.

To retrieve details about a package version create request, including status and package version ID (04t), run "sfdx force:package:version:create:report -i 08c...".

We recommend specifying the --installationkey to protect the contents of your package and to prevent unauthorized installation of your package.

To list package version creation requests in the org, run "sfdx force:package:version:create:list".
