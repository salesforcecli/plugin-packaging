# summary

Schedules a package push upgrade request.

# description

Represents a push upgrade request for upgrading a package in one or many orgs from one version to another version.
To initiate a push upgrade for an unlocked or second-generation managed package, the Create and Update Second-Generation Packages user permission is required.
The push upgrade feature is only available second-generation managed packages that have passed AppExchange security review. To enable push upgrades for your managed package, log a support case in the Salesforce Partner Community.
For unlocked packages, push upgrades are enabled by default.

When the â€“migrate-to-2GP flag is used, this command lets you push a package migration for a first-generation managed package that has been converted to second-generation managed package. This push migration is used to update orgs that have the first-generation managed package installed.
