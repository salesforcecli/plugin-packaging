# cliDescription

install a package in the target org

Supply the ID of the package version to install. The package installs in your default target org unless you supply the username for a different target org.

For package upgrades, to specify options for component deprecation or deletion of removed components, include an --upgradetype value. To delete components that can be safely deleted and deprecate the others, specify --upgradetype Mixed (the default). To deprecate all removed components, specify --upgradetype DeprecateOnly. To delete all removed components, except for custom objects and custom fields, that don't have dependencies, specify --upgradetype Delete. (Note: This option can result in the loss of data that is associated with the deleted components.) The default is Mixed.

# upgradeTypeLong

For package upgrades, specifies whether to mark all removed components as deprecated (DeprecateOnly), to delete removed components that can be safely deleted and deprecate the others (Mixed), or to delete all removed components, except for custom objects and custom fields, that don't have dependencies (Delete). The default is Mixed. Can specify DeprecateOnly or Delete only for unlocked package upgrades.

# apexCompile

compile all Apex in the org and package, or only Apex in the package; unlocked packages only

# apexCompileLong

Applies to unlocked packages only. Specifies whether to compile all Apex in the org and package, or only the Apex in the package.
For package installs into production orgs, or any org that has Apex Compile on Deploy enabled, the platform compiles all Apex in the org after the package install or upgrade operation completes.
This approach assures that package installs and upgrades don’t impact the performance of an org, and is done even if --apexcompile package is specified.
